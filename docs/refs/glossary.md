contig
: A sequence of DNA that has been assembled from a set of overlapping DNA fragments/reads.
  See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contig

N50
: A metric that represents the contiguity of a genome assembly. It's defined as the length of the contig (or scaffold) at which 50% 
of the entire genome is covered by contigs of that length or longer - the higher this number, the better.

L50
: A metric that represents the number of contigs required to cover 50% of the genome's total length - the smaller this number, the better.

AMR
: **A**nti**m**icrobial **r**esistance.

ARG
: **A**ntimicrobial **r**esistance **g**ene.

MAG
: **M**etagenome-**a**ssembled **g**enome - microbial genome reconstructed from metagenomic data.
